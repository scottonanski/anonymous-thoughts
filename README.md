# 🧠 Anonymous Thoughts

### Yell into the void — but like, aesthetically 💅

> A place to drop your **deepest thoughts**, **unfiltered confessions**, or just random brain static.
> No usernames. Just *vibes*.

## 🌐 What is this?

A minimalist, anonymous thought-sharing app for when:

* You're having an **existential crisis** at 2am 🌌
* You need to say something **real**, but not to *real* people 😶
* You want to scroll through the **pure chaos** of others’ minds 🔥

Built with:

🛠️ React + TypeScript + Vite
🎨 Clean AF UI
⚡ Blazing fast, zero bloat

---

## 💻 Get it running (aka “how to scream into the void from localhost”)

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/scottonanski/anonymous-thoughts.git
cd anonymous-thoughts

# Install the vibes
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Let’s get this void lit
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then hit up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
And start typing your weird little thoughts.

## 🧠 Why tho?

Because not everything needs to be performative.
Because sometimes your brain just needs a **dump zone**.
Because doomscrolling should at least be honest.

## ⚡ Real talk

If you made it this far in the README, you either:

* Really care about anonymous social media
* Are avoiding doing your actual project
* Think this README is kinda 🔥 (thank you)

Either way, go check out the app. Or fork it. Or scream into it.
We built this weird little place for you. 🖤
